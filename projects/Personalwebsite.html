        <p class="project-text">
            This website is my first project. I wanted a place to be able to
            share, document, and teach other people my things I'm learning. I
            coded this website in html and css only, I didn't want to have something 
            too complex as I will be adding things. this is only a front-end site, 
            since I'm only going to be sharing what I learn, I don't want to setup an
            account system or anything that would require a back-end system.
        </p>
        <h3 class="project-title">Goals</h3>
        <ul class="project-text">
            <li>Learn HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>Have somewhere to share what I learn</li>
            <li>Make my own website portfolio</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="project-text">
            I learned enough HTML and CSS to make this basic website with basic
            styling such as putting text in the middle of the screen, adding
            bulletpoints, redirecting text, and even
            <span class="red">colors!</span>
        </p>

        <h3 class="project-title">vision</h3>
        <p class="project-text">
            My vision for this website was something to get me more introduced
            into web coding, a platform I can post more indepth writing of my
            projects, and something I can give to people that ask about my
            experience/qualifications. For now, the website is empty and simple,
            but I plan to fill it with my personal projects, industry
            certifications when I get them, and make this into my portfolio.
        </p>
        <h3 class="project-title">process</h3>
        <p class="project-text">
            This project took me about a week to code, I used vscode as my IDE
            because it's the same one I use for python scripts. I started with
            my main goals, I wanted to share what I learn but more personally
            than a Youtube channel. I have a Youtube channel set up for my future
            projects because I've always found videos to be a good learning format,
            this website isn't meant to replace it, but to add to it.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
            After I had this idea, I got to work, I already knew the basic syntax of HTML
            from a coding class I took in High school. The most difficult part for me was
            using CSS, as my class only showed me Scratch, Python, and HTML boilerplate
            code along with headers, titles, and paragraphs. But I managed to learn from
            freecodecamp on youtube, along with some answers about calling css files from
            stackoverflow.

        <p class="project-text">
            All the code from the website is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/Colbs64/MyWebsite" target="_blank">Github</a> and is public, anyone that
            wants to read it can go there.
